# LeetcodeCommitsBot
This is bot that will automatically scrape data regarding the latest questions that I have submitted on Leetcode and will push them into my DSA repository automatically. In this way I don't have to copy paste code in vscode and commit, push everytime I do a new question. This will save me a lot of time.
